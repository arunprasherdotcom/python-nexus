# Pipenv

`pipenv` is a tool that helps manage Python project dependencies and virtual environments. It aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundled dependencies, development dependencies, etc.) to the Python world.

Here's a basic rundown of what it does:

1. **Dependency Management**: `pipenv` automatically manages project dependencies specified in a `Pipfile`. It keeps track of which packages your project depends on and what versions of those packages should be used.

2. **Virtual Environments**: It automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your Python project. This keeps your project's dependencies isolated from the system Python installation and other projects.

3. **Locking Dependencies**: `pipenv` generates a `Pipfile.lock` file, which ensures deterministic builds by locking dependencies to specific versions. This helps in reproducing the same environment across different systems.

4. **Installation and Removal**: `pipenv` provides commands to install and remove dependencies from your project. These commands also update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` accordingly.

5. **Shell Integration**: `pipenv` has a shell command that allows you to spawn a subshell within the virtual environment, making it easy to work within the context of your project.

Overall, `pipenv` simplifies the management of Python projects by providing a unified tool for dependency management and virtual environment handling.


## Pipenv General Commands

1. **Install Packages**: Install packages specified in the `Pipfile`:
   ```sh
   pipenv install
2. **Install Specific Package**: Install a specific package and add it to the Pipfile:
   ```sh
   pipenv install package_name
3. **Install Development Packages**: Install development packages (e.g., testing libraries) and add them to the Pipfile:
   ```sh
   pipenv install --dev
4. **Uninstall Package**: Remove a package from the virtual environment and the Pipfile:
   ```sh
   pipenv uninstall package_name
5. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Create a new virtual environment:
   ```sh
   pipenv --python python_version --name custom_name
6. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Enter the virtual environment shell:
    ```sh
    pipenv shell --venv custom_name
7. **Run a Command in the Virtual Environment**: Execute a command within the virtual environment without activating it:
    ```sh
    pipenv run python3.9 script.py
8. **Check Security Vulnerabilities**: Check for security vulnerabilities in installed dependencies:
    ```sh
    pipenv check
9. **Update Packages**: Update packages to their latest versions:
    ```sh
    pipenv update --venv custom_name
10. **Generate requirements.txt**: Generate a requirements.txt file from the Pipfile.lock:
    ```sh
    pipenv lock -r
## Pipfile vs requirements.txt

1. **Structure**:
   - **Pipfile**: Written in TOML format, supports multiple sections like `[packages]` and `[dev-packages]`.
   - **requirements.txt**: Simple text file listing package names, often with version constraints.

2. **Version Specification**:
   - **Pipfile**: Offers flexible version specification including ranges and wildcards.
   - **requirements.txt**: Typically uses operators like `==`, `>=`, or `~=`, less flexible than Pipfile.

3. **Usage**:
   - **Pipfile**: Managed by `pipenv`, used for dependency and virtual environment management.
   - **requirements.txt**: Widely used with standard `pip` tool for installing dependencies directly.

4. **Locking Dependencies**:
   - **Pipfile**: Generates a `Pipfile.lock` for locking dependencies to specific versions.
   - **requirements.txt**: Doesn't inherently lock dependencies, but can be achieved with tools like `pip-tools`.

## In summary, Pipfile and requirements.txt serve different purposes:

1. **Pipfile**:
   - More feature-rich with flexible versioning and locking mechanisms.
   - Managed by pipenv for dependency and virtual environment management.

2. **requirements.txt**:
   - Simpler format commonly used with standard pip for direct dependency installation.

3. **Installation Difference**: The installation of dependencies varies between using a `requirements.txt` file and `pipenv`:
   - `pip` directly installs dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file.
   - `pipenv` creates and manages a virtual environment along with installing dependencies specified in a `Pipfile`.
   - To install dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file using `pipenv`, you can use the command `pipenv install -r path/to/requirements.txt`.
